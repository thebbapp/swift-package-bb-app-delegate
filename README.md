# ``BbAppDelegate``

Application delegate for platform-specific lifecycle management.

## Overview

The BbAppDelegate library provides a unified application delegate that handles platform-specific lifecycle events across iOS, tvOS, and macOS. It manages push notification registration and handling, device token management through Combine publishers, notification presentation while the app is in the foreground, and user interaction with notifications. This delegate serves as the bridge between system notifications and application state.
